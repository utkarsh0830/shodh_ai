Shodh AI ‚Äì Contest Judge Backend

A high-performance backend service designed to power online coding contest platforms. Shodh AI provides live judging of user submissions by executing code in secure, sandboxed Docker environments.

Secure Code Execution: Leverages Docker to run user-submitted code in isolated, sandboxed containers, preventing malicious code and ensuring system stability.

Live Judging: Provides real-time feedback on submissions (e.g., Accepted, Wrong Answer, Time Limit Exceeded, Compilation Error).

RESTful API: A clean and robust API for handling problem submissions, retrieving results, and managing contest status.

Scalable Architecture: Built with Java and Gradle for a reliable and scalable service capable of handling concurrent submissions.
